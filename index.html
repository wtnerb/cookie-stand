      <h3>our story</h3>
      <p>One day, Pat, our beloved leader - long may he reign, was feeding his cat while eating a cookie. The smell of the <a href="https://www.luckyvitamin.com/th-salmon-cat-food">organic salmon</a> in the food combined with the cookie in his hand to delightful effect. Ever since that moment, our beloved leader has dedicated himself heart and soul to bringing you this new tradition of the Northwest.</p>
